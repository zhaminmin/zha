    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>In the E-Laas project, a novel and operational energy-based approach to designing multimodal urban logistics
        systems is proposed.
        As such, urban delivery systems are compared by their energy used,
        including modal shift (micro platforms) and novel ways of combining
        charging and freight parking. This energy-based quantitative methodology enables us to
        systematically and naturally define sustainability aims. Thus, our overall aim with E-Laas
        is to create a novel energy minimizing method from consolidation centers to the customers' doors incentivizing
        energy savings at each level. Furthermore, the energy-based methodology enables us to contrast different modular
        solutions via the concept of interlaced energy footprinting.</p>
    <p>The aims of the project are:
    <ul>
        <li>A1: representing urban logistics missions as logistics flows.</li>
        <li>A2: defining operational (and complementary) energy use in logistics flows. </li>
        <li>A3: analyzing spatio-temporal energy usage in urban logistics missions and perform sensitivity analysis
            (grid interruption, scalability).</li>
        <li>A4: energy awareness on multiple levels (from customers to asuthorities) is aimed to incentivize.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assumptions, Project Objectives and Targets</h2>
    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <p>
    <dl>
        <dt>&#9824 AP1: We assume that the flow of goods related to the development of civilization
            together with consumption will not cease to increase. If no coordinated actions are done,
            it will negatively impact our lives.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP2: The development of digital and telecommunications techniques makes it possible to implement IoT,
            ICT,
            and ITS solutions in cities. It is hence assumed that relevant operational, and real-time data are
            available.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP3: The development of synchronized, energy-optimal operational actions is assumed to enhance
            sustainability, efficiency,
            and social awareness of city logistics since we leverage optimization methods to improve the systems. As
            such, we also assume
            that the problems of urban logistics operations can be explicitly formulated as optimization problems, for
            which some modelling
            assumptions will be needed.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP4: It is assumed that increased environmental awareness of residents and service providers related
            to the implementation
            of new solutions will positively impact the sustainable transition.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP5: Calibration data to emulate service aspects behind E-Laas is provided by the partners/publicly
            available. Customers behave rationally.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP6: Socio aspects can be interpreted within/map to the energy aware methodology.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP7: We assume that cities will have an overview, and can use E-Laas to create legal standards to
            incentivise resource optimal urban shipping.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP8: Solution and technological tools to make the impact via the E-Laas methods exist and are
            operational.</dt>
    </dl>
    </p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
    <dl>
        <dt>&#9824 O1: contributing to sustainable developments of cities and communities.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 O2: creating resilient logistics methods, digital and physical infrastructure for sustainable
            transport solutions.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 O3: developing sustainable and climate-responsive urban logistic systems.</dt>
    </dl>
    </p>
    <h3>Targets</h3>
    <p>
    <dl>
        <dt>&#9824 T1: Develop energy-optimal urban logistics solutions (from consolidation centers to doors).</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T2: Develop smart multimodal and energy optimizing micro delivery systems.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T3: Analyze logistics mission interruptions and advise with reconfiguration solutions to regain
            energy optimality.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T4: Couple delivery platforms and unloading zones via charging facility to the power grid.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T5: Quantify demand for freight and analyze the customer behavior change required to run the project
            E-Laas.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T6: Scalability of multimodal and energy optimal distribution system.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T7: Devise new ways to enhance societal responsibility by E-Laas.</dt>

    <h2>Key Activities and Work Programme Description</h2>
    <h3>Overall strategy for the work plan</h3>
    <p>
        We focus on teamwork, and all work packages are done by multiple partners. Four universities as the main
        partners will be more active in the project to undertake
        the core research work. However, other cooperation partners, including public sectors and companies, will be
        less work loading responsible for the collaborative
        work and undertaking the auxiliary work of providing data, pilot implementation, policy support, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is composed of 7 work packages combined into a logical workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
        WP0 is the starting task of the project. It develops detailed assumptions for the implementation of further works. The realization of WPs 1, 2, 3, and 4 is parallel. WP1 is independent of WP3 and WP4, which are closely related according to the implementation methodology. WP2 will be implemented on the base of assumptions from WP0 and will be fed with the results of WPs 1, 3, and 4, influencing the final result. WP2 and WP3 contain simulation studies, but at a different level of detail, it should be emphasized that research in WP2 is of fundamental nature to gain new knowledge, and in WP3, applied research to verify and validate the developed mathematical models and algorithms. WP5 is aimed at consolidating the project results in the assumed impact path and will also consider the effects of analyses from WP2. 
The WP6 aims to ensure unrestricted and broad access to the project's results, implementation progress, and the distribution of its outcomes among stakeholders.
    </p>
    <h3>Timing of different WPs and components</h3>
    <p>In Figures 2 and 3, the interconnection of WPs is depicted. In Fig 3, the coupling among the WPs is shown; arrows indicate the information and data coupling between two consecutive WPs. Fig 2 describes the timeline of WPs, including milestones and deliverables. Risk assessment is added too, see dashed WPs. Each and every WP has its respective deliverables and milestones to achieve. In the project E-Laas, we intend to create a new research community, too, meaning that Co-Applicants will be involved in nearly all WPs. This is done intentionally. However, the level of involvement changes from WP to WP.</p>

    <h2>Relevance and Impact Pathway</h2>
    <h3>Relevance — Contribution of the project to the aims and expectations of the call</h3>
    <p>
        E-Laas proposes a socio-economic solution to reach the holistic goal with sustainable urban logistics well
        exploiting the benefits of digital and physical infrastructure. In E-Laas, an overall energy footprint is
        minimized and coupled to the power grid. Furthermore, the societal responsibility in achieving such a transition
        is emphasized via environmental, ethical, and eco-philanthropic aspects. We cover the following topics in the
        call from Theme 1.
    <dl>
        <dt>&#9827 We develop energy-optimal urban logistics solutions from distribution centers to customers' doors.
        </dt>
        <dt>&#9827 We create smart multimodal and energy-optimizing micro delivery systems.</dt>
        <dt>&#9827 We provide tools to analyze logistics mission interruptions and propose reconfiguration solutions.
        </dt>
        <dt>&#9827 We couple delivery platforms and unloading zones via the charging facility to the power grid for more
            efficient recharging.</dt>
        <dt>&#9827 We quantify the demand and customer perceptions that drive E-Laas.</dt>
        <dt>&#9827 We scale multimodal and energy-optimal distribution systems for different cities.</dt>

        As part of WP, close cooperation is planned in the form of direct interaction:
    <dl>
        <dt>— once a month online and stationary workshops among all the partners (CUT, SU, TU, WUT, SC, GZM, SUD, PU,
            VGTT);</dt>
        <dt>— face-to-face consultations as well as videoconferences, which are separate meetings with a cooperation
            partner as needed(SC, GZM, SUD, PU, VGTT).</dt>
    </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
        And in the form of indirect interaction:
    <dl>
        <dt>— sharing the data on logistic systems helpful in carrying out work in the project held by partners (SC,
            GZM, SUD);</dt>
        <dt>— scientific and specialist publications prepared in a non-specialist language, popular science, and
            information materials (e.g., website, brochures, leaflets) developed by scientists (CUT, WUT, SU, TU)
            providing knowledge to other stakeholders (SC, GZM, SUD, PU and others);</dt>
        <dt>— data available in the form of open access, simulation models, research results, and reports that can be
            used by other scientists not related to the project, as well as other stakeholders (SC, GZM, SUD, PU, and
            others).</dt>
    </dl>
    </p>
    <h3>Strategic Activity Planning</h3>
    <h4>Stakeholder engagement</h4>
    <p> E-Laas involves a balanced team comprised of: (a) universities, (b) authorities at different levels, (c)
        industry actors.</p>
    <p>
        E-Laas will focus mainly on three types of actors that are part of business and society:
        <br>(i) society and public sector have a clean environment and a fossil-free transport system as a priority for
        the next 30 years, which means city authorities need to get knowledge on how to transition towards a new
        e-system and how to satisfy business and society needs to make this new reality feasible;
        <br>(ii) transport companies that are in the middle of a transition towards e-vehicles and need a new system
        designed for this transition that ensures a reliable supply of energy at the right place and time;
        <br>(iii) tech-based companies and innovators, these are companies with innovative business models that aim at
        creating value from digitalization and the need for a new system towards electrification. The models and
        simulation will use the input from these actors.
    </p>
    <h4>Communication</h4>
    <p>Communication and dissemination strategy: In order to ensure that the results of E-Laas will have an extensive
        reach during the project but also the desired success after the project, a strategy will be designed to raise
        awareness of the project’s results. Project partners will integrate the project communication with their own
        well-established communication networks.</p>
    <p>
        E-Laas will use a combination of communication channels, including:
    <dl>
        <dt>&#9830 Digital communication and social media: this will offer an immediate form of communication.</dt>
        <dt>&#9830 Conferences and events: key conferences and events including (not limited to): TRA Transport Research
            Arena, the VREF Conference on Urban Freight, INFORMS Annual Meeting, and TRB annual meetings.</dt>
        <dt>&#9830 Project events: there will be at least three local stakeholder workshops to engage local and national
            stakeholders and present them with the project results.</dt>
        <dt>&#9830 Scientific publications: E-Laas will publish scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals: e.g.
            Transportation Research Part series. We aim at publishing in open access venues without restriction in order
            to enlarge the target audience.</dt>
    </dl>
    </p>
    <h4>Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning</h4>
    <p>The E-Laas project will follow the commonly known Plan, Do, Check and Act circle, and will start by identifying
        the needs of the main stakeholders. Based on these needs, E-Laas will develop and implement an energy-based
        framework for urban logistics systems and new innovative services.</p>
    <p>Based on real-life experiences and stated expectations and perceptions E-Laas will assess the actual impacts.
        Measured impacts and perceived benefits will be used in the implementation guidelines. The impacts of the
        proposed solutions will be measured by well-defined and measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Some of
        the key elements in order to monitor the process of the project are: International cooperation: The success of
        the project will require cooperation and alignment of the work in the different work packages and cities and
        countries involved. Cross-fertilising operation between stakeholders: The lessons learned will be shared between
        the stakeholders, thus each stakeholder will not only gain experiences from their own work but from the work of
        all of the other partners in all cities. This will be done on multiple levels, from frequent management meetings
        to webinars. Close monitoring of operational KPIs: Project management will ensure closer monitoring or agreed
        actions and operational KPIs.</p>
    <h4>Capacity strengthening</h4>
    <p>This project will use two pillars to support the capacity strengthening strategy in a way that results are both
        cutting-edge research and ready for utilization and scaling-up: (i) the academic network and (ii) the engagement
        of stakeholders and their networks.</p>

    <h3> Consortium collaboration</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Cooperation partners: </b>The project involves many cooperation partners from both sides (Sino-European).
        Partners representing authorities, SE, and LE cover a wide range of responsibilities both in terms of activities
        and size.
        <br><br><b>Synergies within Group Europe: </b>CUT will dedicate to the tasks of the business models designed for
        E-Laas. These tasks first need sufficient data and information to support the designs and also need the
        simulation analysis to provide feedback to improve the design. On that front, data collection and simulation
        analysis are the strengths of WUT.
        <br><br><b>Synergies within Group China:</b>SU will dedicate to planning large-scale urban logistics systems for
        E-Laas. These strategic planning decisions have strong independencies with operations. To complement that, TU
        will dedicate to designing operational models and algorithms for the systems, which will provide feedback to
        strategic planning.
        <br><br><b>Synergies between Group China and Group Europe:</b>Group Europe will build the concepts and
        foundation of E-Laas. And based on that, Group China will push them to the deployment and implementation.
        However, this is not unidirectional. The deployment and implementation will generate more data and knowledge for
        us to better understand E-Laas, and based on that we can re-design the concepts and foundation.
    </p>
    <h3>Diversity aspects (including gender dimension) or specific populations' consideration</h3>
    <p>
        The diversity of this project reflects multiple aspects. First, the selection of our team partners is considered
        from multiple perspectives. Second, the choice of each member is also prudent, considering the multiple
        dimension diversity. Third, our research covers most logistics issues across the energy-based multimodal urban
        logistics system.
    </p>
    <h3>Added value of Sino-European cooperation</h3>
    <p>
    <dl>
        <dt>— The variety of Chinese and European cities in terms of different population sizes, urban layouts,
            geographical conditions, etc., is an opportunity for an in-depth understanding of the processes taking place
            and for matching solution modules to the scale of the system.</dt>
        <dt>— Communities, companies, and individuals in Europe have made significant achievements in sustainability.
            Thus, Sino-European cooperation can lead to advanced sustainable logistics solutions.</dt>
        <dt>— The Chinese market is very dynamic in the development of micro delivery systems. This creates great
            industrial opportunities to deploy E-Laas solutions.</dt>
        <dt>— The characteristics of customers, their different behaviors, and their needs in the Chinese and European
            markets will enable a thorough examination of a wide range of factors influencing the demand for specific
            services and allow the precise adjustment of the E-Laas architecture.</dt>
        <dt>— Sharing good experiences and practices between partners, cultural enrichment.</dt>
        <dt>— Strengthening relations between selected European and Chinese cities forming the consortium.</dt>
    </dl>
    </p>
    <h3>Management structure and procedures</h3>
    <p>
        The overall project management of E-Laas will comply with the following two major principles: (1) Principle of
        creating an integrated project structure incorporating technical, scientific and partner coordination; and (2)
        Principle of achieving agreements upon all partners guaranteeing the arrangement of decision making, and
        concealing the reliable agreements to protect intellectual properties of all partners.
        Procedures include communication amongst consortium partners, consortium meetings, decision-making process,
        conflict resolution procedure, conflict resolution procedure and monitoring and reporting.
    </p>
    <h2>Ethical and Regulatory Considerations</h2>
    <p>Data management practices will follow the EU Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research. All data collection
        and processing tasks within E-Laas consortium will be GDPR compliant. Any collected data such as urban
        infrastructure data and survey data, will be anonymized/pseudonymized. Partners must explain how all the data
        they intend to process is relevant and limited to the purposes of their intended task in accordance with the
        “data minimization” principle.</p>
    <h2>Data Management</h2>
    <p>E-Laas has the following Data Management Plan (DMP) following the open-source publishing policy where it is
        possible.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Storage, archive. </b>Data storage and backup of research data during the project will be stored at the
        partners and at the E-Laas website. After the end of the E-Laas (during), partners publication libraries will be
        used. Some data will be published together with papers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Data type. </b>Type 1: Results will be based on synthetic data in WP2, WP3, WP4. Type 2: Confidential data in
        WP0 or WP1, not shared. Type 3: Data generated via questionary in WP2 will be anonymized and shared.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Standards. </b>We will use available standards when working with data: ISO/IEC JTC1/SC32. Type 1 data will
        use SI units when synthetically created for WP2-4. Type 2 data in WP0-1 uses SI units (duration, position).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Documentation. </b>In WP0-4, we will clearly describe how the data were generated or collected/received.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Compliance with legislation, ethical requirements. </b>No individual or personal data will be used in the
        project. Chinese and European (GDPR) legislation will be enforced, whichever is more restrictive.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements.</b>
        The consortium partners will lay down all issues linked to access rights, protection of IP, the use of licenses,
        etc., in the Consortium Agreement, which will be concluded at the start of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives. </b>When publishing with Type 1 and partially
        Type 3 data in E-Laas we follow CC BY-NC.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Resources. </b>Each partner is responsible to run their dedicated data management and ensuring that data will
        be FAIR.

    <h2>Justification of Resources</h2>
    <p>
        CUT costs in the project E-Laas will cover 28,32 person-months for 5 team members. Direct (non personal) costs
        will be used to cover travel costs to participation in scientific conferences and minor IT, literature, and some
        representative costs. And CUT will host one of the yearly E-Laas workshops, added as a cost item.
    </p>
    <p>
        SU and TU will split the budget on the Chinese side (with 60% and 40%). Their costs include labor costs for
        supporting research students and consulting services, domestic travel costs, international travel costs and the
        budget to publish the project result in professional outlets.
    </p>
    <p>
        The WUT budget was mainly planned based on NCN guides. The costs will cover 45.6 person-months for 9 team
        members. For the purposes of the works, it is planned to renew the license for the simulation tool and purchase
        a research stand. The purchase of office supplies, the development of the Polish website for the E-Laas project
        and funds for promotional materials were planned. Subcontracting includes costs for the implementation of
        surveys, translation and linguistic proofreading of documents, reports and articles. Also, the costs include
        travel costs and the overhead for publishing articles.
